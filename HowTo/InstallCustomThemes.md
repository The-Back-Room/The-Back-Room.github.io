## How to Install Custom Themes on Windows
Custom themes can significantly enhance the visual appeal of your Windows desktop. This guide will walk you through the steps to install custom themes on your Windows operating system.

### Step 1: Download a Custom Theme
1. Find a trusted source for custom Windows themes. Some popular websites include DeviantArt, ThemePack.me, and WinCustomize.
2. Download the theme file, which is usually in `.theme`, `.deskthemepack`, or `.zip` format.

### Step 2: Prepare Your System
1. Before installing a custom theme, it's essential to back up your system. Create a restore point or back up your important files.
2. Download and install [SecureUxTheme Patcher](https://github.com/namazso/SecureUxTheme/releases/latest). This tool allows you to use third-party themes by patching system files.
3. Restart your computer to apply the changes made by the patcher.

### Step 3: Install the Custom Theme
1. Download the desired theme. Prefereably a `ZIP` archive as `EXE` installers may contain unwanted software and often contain malware.
2. Extract the contents of the downloaded file using a file extraction tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
3. Look for the folder containing the `.theme` file and copy the contents to the `%SYSTEMROOT%\Resources\Themes` directory. You can access this folder by typing the path into the File Explorer address bar.
4. If the theme includes additional files (such as wallpapers or icons), follow the included instructions for installing those elements.
