## IMPORTANT NOTICE

{: .warning }
> {: .opaque }
> ⚠️ **Trigger Warning**: This page is a rant about my opinion on modern over sensitivity and as such will contain strong language. If you are easily triggered, leave now.

This is going to be a bit of an extensive rant and I may or may not add more to it over time. So, I'll simply start of with the problem with common sense these days *(or better yet the lack of common sense)*. 

### Common Sense

To put it in simple terms, I was raised to always think before opening my mouth and actually use my brain to figure shit out for myself; which is something I have noticed nobody bothers to do anymore *(or at least nobody seems to know how to do anymore)*. I've seen so much bull shit now that it honestly makes me think this world is literally going to kill itself in the next 2-3 generations.

People need to start actually using their brains. If you see someone doing stupid or dangerous shit, naturally you *DON'T REPEAT IT*! But apparently people seem to think it's *~cool~* or *~trendy~* do not only do this shit, but post it all over social media for fucking views! And this is just the tip of the fucking iceberg. This has extended to the point of people trying to force their own personal opions on others and in doing so causing a massive takedown of content from media that was actually beneficial to people.

#### Censorship and Over Sensitivity

Nowadays, if something depicts anything they don't personally like, all of a sudden it's too much and has to be pulled! I'm sorry but what the actual fuck is going on in your brain. How about you grow a spine and take ths stick out of your ass instead. That would do much more good than choosing to discriminate against something that isn't harming anyone.

Some examples of topics being targeted include *(but aren't limited to)*:

- Comedic Violence
- Classic Cartoons
- Anime and/or Hentai
- Adult Entertainment
- AI Generated Content

The media industry is recieveing the largest amount of bull shit right now due to millenial karens who never learned the difference between reality and fiction. There are too many people claiming that just because it depicts something that doesn't fit their opinion of what an adult looks like that all of a sudden the creators and viewers *must* be pedopiles. Again ... *WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK* is wrong with your head? Pedophiles don't care about animated characters who *DON'T  EXIST*! The whole reason they are pedophiles is because they target *REAL CHILDREN*. You need to get the fuck out of office and go back to school as you clearly didn't learn anything the last time you were there. Animated characters *DO NOT EXIST*. As such they cannot be tied to a legal age. In order to do so there needs to be a physical birth date ... which would require them to *ACTUALLY EXIST*. 

If a real person were being depicted then naturally that would be a completely different story. That *WOULD* be pedophilia if the person depicted were a child and *ACTUALLY EXISTS*. But most of these cases are against completely imaginary characters who simply *LOOK* a certain way, have no real age since they *DON'T EXIST*, and are often times canonically *OLDER THAN YOUR FUCKING ANCESTORS*! Again, this once again points to *KNOWING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REALITY AND FICTION*!

And then there is the crap about people just being themselves being labelled as pedophiles or perverts. Like this crap about someone trying to make drag queens illegal now claiming thatdrag queens are pedophiles ... *Are you on acid?* ... Drag shows are adult entertainment and literally don't allow children in. Not to mention there has never been any mention of children in relation to drag shows until some dumbass decided to call drag queens perverts and pedophiles. What's next? Are you going after Geisha's too? Just so you know, those are men too and they aren't perverts or pedophiles. In fact I can guarentee you would be basically getting yourself in deep shit if you even tried to pull that shit.


#### Trans Offenders and WOKE Bull Shit

Moving on ... I'm all for the LGBTQ+ community and have nothing against them. Hell, I myself am part of that community since I'm literally pans+poly *(For those who have no brain, that means Pansexual and Polyamorous)*. But, that doesn't mean I approve of the woke bull shit that is arrising. For instance, public restrooms do *NOT* exist to give a fuck about your *GENDER IDENTITY*. You will *ALWAYS* be biologically the gender you were born as. That is engraned in your genetic code and can't be changed. Public restrooms are seperated by *BIOLOGICAL GENDER* not your gender identity; This is safety measure to protect children from perverts and pedophiles. It is also why most places have a seperate restroom for only *ONE PERSON*. This is where anyone who had a gender operation would go; It *IS NOT* limited solely to parents. If you were born male, had a sex change operation to become female and suddenly believe you are allowed or entitled to use the women's restroom ... reality check ... *YOU'RE NOT*. You're biological gender is *STILL MALE*; You simply had your body surgically altered. As such you now use the solo restroom *(or if there isn't one, then you piss in your pants if you can't hold it in)*. Naturally this goes vica-versa as well. You're biological gender is what public restrooms are representing and it's national law not personal opinion. Violating this can and will land you a permanent spot on a public list as a sex offender. And personally I'm one of those who belive pedophiles and sex offenders deserve the death sentance *(in the most inhumane way possible at that since they clearly don't care about their victims' humanity)*.

If I ever come across a place with a trans restroom, I will leave and never come back because *THAT* is a serious safety concern since not all trans people have the operation for the reasons they claim. Although extremely rare, it is *NOT* impossible for someone to get a sex change operation for the sole purpose of gaining access to the opposite gender's public restrooms; It is also *NOT* unheard of as such operations *HAVE BEEN DONE ILLEGALLY* in the past for exactly such reasons.

#### AI Paranoia

Too many people are overly paranoid about the use of AI in media. All this bull shit about *~AI is art theft~* or some bull shit along that line. First off ... fuck you .. you clearly have no idea what the hell you're talking about and I honestly don't give a fuck about your opinion if this is the level of stupidity you are spouting ...


AI generators may have started off lacking in preventive measures, but now they all have some way of preventing users from stealing art. There are literally registrees that people can register to in order to preotect their art from being used through AI scrapers. In fact, proper AI image tools don't even scrape art anymore but lierally use manually built Lora's created by people who literally made them for public use to *CREATE* the image. Point being, if you're using an AI image generator that scraping images instead of creating them, chances are it's not a legal tool and I would seriously have to question where the fuck you got it *(pot ... meet kettle)*.

The majority of my art *IS* AI generated. Not because I'm too lazy to draw it myself. But, because I am both physically and mentally disabled and physically can't hold my hands steady enough to be able to draw by hand. None of the tools I use are scraping images from the web. They literally make the images using pre coded loras and publicly available scripts. The images are modelled after the prompts I put in and almost always require multiple attempts to get one that fits the generaly idea of wehat I am attempting to make.

If you have beef with the fact that I use AI image generators and want to give me hell for it, than kindly gtfo (get the fuck out) of my website. As I have no interest in dealing with you or your bull shit and I will just tell you to fuck right the hell off.

### Final Note

There is *A LOT* more that I could go into in this rant and probably will in the future. But, for now I will stop here so as to not piss myself off. However, people need to start actually using their brains. Things are not black and white and humanity would be physically non-existant if they were. 

We humans learn and grow through conflict. No we don't need to go and kill ourselves, but the censorship and oversensitibity we have now is causing more and more damage. If people keep up like this, then I honestly don't have any hope for our future as a species. There are an infinite number of ways people can die in this world, and you idiots are too busy losing your shit over harmless bull shit to learn how to actually survive in the world.
