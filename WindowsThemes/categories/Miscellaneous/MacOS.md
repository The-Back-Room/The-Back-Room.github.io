## MacOS Themes for Windows 10 and 11

Theme packs for Windows 10 and 11 inspired by the MacOS operating system.

![Preview](https://gitlab.com/the-back-room/deskthemepacks/sfw/macos/-/raw/main/Extras/Preview.bmp)

The screenshot displays the theme being used alongside our DownAero Squared Windhawk theme. You can find instructions on how to obtain and set that up [here](/WindowsThemes/c/windhawk/DownAeroSquared).

Due to changes in Windows 11, you will need the Windhawk plugin [Logon, Logoff, and Shutdown Sounds Restored](https://windhawk.net/mods/logon-logoff-shutdown-sounds) to enable the Logon, Logoff, and Shutdown sounds on Windows 11.
